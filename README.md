# Collazo_Albert2_Portfolio

This Portfolio’s purpose is to highlight my coursework and projects as I complete them. Everything that represents my brand and showcases my work ethic and creativity will be added into this portfolio as a representation of myself.
Over time I will remove the old and update with new and more relevant material. I plan to keep this portfolio updated and maintained on a regular basis.
